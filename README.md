## 🎯 Current Focus (2024-2025)

**Learning & Building:**
- 🐍 **Python** for data processing, APIs, and automation (intermediate level)
- ☁️ **Cloud-native technologies** (AWS, containerization)
- 📊 **Data Engineering fundamentals** (ETL, pipelines, data quality)
- 🤖 **AI/ML foundations** (Oracle OCI 2025 AI Certified, GitHub Copilot)

**Active Projects:**
- Web API consumption and data extraction
- Data processing pipelines with Python
- Database migration patterns (RDBMS → modern stacks)
- Automation scripts for data workflows
