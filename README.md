## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey **expanding from traditional database engineering excellence into modern cloud-native and data technologies**.

After 25 years architecting enterprise Oracle database solutions, I'm actively building hands-on expertise in Python, cloud platforms, and modern data stack while leveraging my deep database foundations.

**Why public learning?** Because the best way to master new technologies is to build real projects, share knowledge, and engage with the developer community.
